# Computer-Science-Master-Thesis-EPN-Template
This is a fist draw of a template for the FIS Computer Scince Master Program at Escuela Polit√©cnica Nacional. 
This template is based on an Overleaf Template found at: put_address_here. It was modified to generate a document 
as similar as possible to the font and style used in EPN

To use: just download the zip file and upload it to Overleaf if you want to work there. In texmaker or latex studio some additional work may be needed because of the Arial type of Font
