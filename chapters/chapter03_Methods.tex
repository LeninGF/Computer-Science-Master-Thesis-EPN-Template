\section{Problem Formulation}
In supervised learning, we aim to find a $\phi(\cdot)$ that maps an input space $\mathcal{X}$ to an output space (known as labels), $\mathcal{Y}$, as described by \eqref{eq:supervisedlearning}.

\begin{equation}
    \phi: \mathbf{\mathcal{X}} \rightarrow \mathcal{Y}    
    \label{eq:supervisedlearning}
\end{equation}
