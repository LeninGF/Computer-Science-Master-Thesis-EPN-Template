# Computer-Science-Master-Thesis-EPN-Template
This is a fist draw of a template for the FIS Computer Science Master Program at Escuela Politécnica Nacional. 
This template is based on the tutorial "How to write a thesis in latex" by  Josh Cassidy, and available at https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/How_to_Write_a_Thesis_in_LaTeX_(Part_1):_Basic_Structure.

The original design has been modified to address the font and style used in Escuela Politécnica Nacional.
### How to use
Download the zip file and upload it to Overleaf, if you want to work there. In texmaker or latex studio some additional work may be needed because of the Arial type of Font. This is a to do.

### How to compile
Since the type of font is Arial, which is not a native Latex style, **LuaLatex must be set as Latex compiler**
